# gui_test

The aim of the project is to provide a GUI to an user in order to test a videoconferencing equipment.
Bassicaly the interface is composed of buttons. Each button corresponds to a type of inconvenience. It can be either audio or video.
The user has to click on the button when something is bothering him during the session.

Finally the results are recorded in a file with the type of inconvenience and the recorded time.
